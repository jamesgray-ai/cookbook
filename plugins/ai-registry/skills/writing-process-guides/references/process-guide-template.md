## Section Guidelines

### Purpose
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Connect to business outcomes (revenue, efficiency, risk)
- Answer: "What happens if we don't do this?"

### When to Execute
- Be specific about timing (not "regularly" but "Every Sunday at 10am")
- Include duration estimate for planning
- Note any dependencies or prerequisites

### Process Overview
- Visual representation of workflow flow
- Show outputs at each stage
- Keep it simple - details are in the SOPs

### Workflow Sequence
- One entry per workflow in execution order
- Include trigger (what starts it), duration, and output
- Link to the workflow page (which has the SOP)
- Note handoffs between workflows

### Decision Points
- Only include meaningful branch points
- Provide clear criteria for each option
- Always include a default/fallback

### Success Criteria
- Tangible, verifiable outputs
- Include both leading and lagging indicators
- Should be checkable within 24-48 hours

### Common Pitfalls
- Focus on mistakes that actually happen (not theoretical)
- Provide actionable prevention, not just warnings
- 2-4 pitfalls maximum

## Domain-Specific Adaptations

### Operations Processes (e.g., Weekly Review)
- Emphasize rhythm and consistency
- Include time-blocking recommendations
- Focus on habit formation

### Marketing Processes (e.g., Cohort Launch)
- Include timeline with milestones
- Connect to conversion metrics
- Note content dependencies

### Sales Processes (e.g., Graduate Upsell)
- Emphasize timing relative to customer journey
- Include personalization points
- Connect to revenue targets

## Writing Tips

1. **Start with the end**: What does success look like?
2. **Time-box everything**: People need to plan their calendar
3. **Link, don't repeat**: Reference SOPs for details
4. **Make it scannable**: Someone should understand in 2 minutes
5. **Include the "why"**: Context motivates execution
