# Naming Workflows

Generate consistent, professional names and descriptions for business workflows, then create entries in the Notion Workflows database.

## Workflow Naming Rules

### Format Requirements
- **Length**: 2-4 words maximum
- **Structure**: Noun phrases (not verb phrases)
- **Style**: Title case
- **Clarity**: Self-explanatory without context

### Naming Patterns by Domain

**Sales workflows:**
- Pattern: `[Prospect Type] [Action]`
- Examples: Student Enrollment, Lead Qualification, Proposal Generation

**Marketing workflows:**
- Pattern: `[Content Type] [Action/Purpose]`
- Examples: Newsletter Distribution, Social Media Scheduling, Content Repurposing

**Product workflows:**
- Pattern: `[Deliverable] [Action]`
- Examples: Lesson Content Creation, Curriculum Design, Exercise Development

**Education workflows:**
- Pattern: `[Student/Cohort] [Activity]`
- Examples: Student Onboarding, Course Access Setup, Live Session Delivery

**Consulting workflows:**
- Pattern: `[Deliverable/Phase] [Action]`
- Examples: Engagement Planning, Strategic Assessment, Implementation Support

**Operations workflows:**
- Pattern: `[Function] [Process]`
- Examples: Email Response Drafting, Calendar Management, System Maintenance

**Finance workflows:**
- Pattern: `[Transaction Type] [Action]`
- Examples: Invoice Generation, Payment Processing, Revenue Tracking

### Common Patterns

| If workflow monitors/checks | Use "[Subject] Monitoring" or "[Subject] Review" |
| If workflow creates output | Use "[Output] Creation" or "[Output] Generation" |
| If workflow sends/distributes | Use "[Item] Distribution" or "[Item] Delivery" |
| If workflow onboards/sets up | Use "[Subject] Onboarding" or "[Subject] Setup" |
| If workflow recovers/follows up | Use "[Subject] Recovery" or "[Subject] Follow-up" |

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

❌ Verb phrases: "Managing Email", "Creating Content"
❌ Too generic: "Daily Task", "Process 1"
❌ Too long: "Student Enrollment Payment Processing and Confirmation"
❌ Tool-focused: "Claude Email Tool", "Using Zapier for X"
❌ Jargon without context: "SOP-001", "Flow Alpha"

## Description Writing

### Format
Write 1-2 concise sentences that answer:
1. **What** does this workflow do?
2. **What** is the outcome/output?

### Structure
`[Action verb] [object] [context/condition]. [Outcome statement].`

### Examples

**Good descriptions:**
- "Review Gmail for emails requiring responses and draft replies. Generates draft responses ready for user review."
- "Convert Maven waitlist prospects into enrolled students through targeted email campaigns. Results in payment confirmations and enrollment completions."
- "Extract key insights from lesson recordings and repurpose into LinkedIn posts and Substack content. Produces 5+ social assets per lesson."

**Avoid:**
- Overly detailed: "This workflow checks the Gmail inbox every morning at 7:30 AM using Claude's email skill to scan for messages that..."
- Too vague: "Handles email stuff"
- Tool-focused: "Uses Claude and Gmail to do email"

## Process Outcome Writing

### Format
Write a short phrase (2-5 words) naming the concrete business deliverable.

### Requirements
- **Tangible**: Something that can be reviewed, sent, or measured
- **Specific**: Not "completed workflow" or "done"
- **Noun phrase**: The thing produced, not the action

### Examples

| Workflow | Process Outcome |
|----------|-----------------|
| Email Response Drafting | Draft email responses |
| Lead Qualification | Qualified lead list |
| Content Repurposing | 5+ social assets |
| Student Onboarding | Onboarded students |
| Newsletter Distribution | Published newsletter |
| Invoice Generation | Sent invoices |

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- ❌ "Workflow completed" (not tangible)
- ❌ "Emails processed" (too vague)
- ❌ "Done" (not descriptive)
- ❌ "Successfully ran the email workflow" (action, not deliverable)

## Workflow Context Properties

When naming/describing workflows, consider these Notion properties:

**Domain** (inherited from Business Process):
- Sales, Marketing, Product, Education, Consulting, Operations, Finance

**Trigger**:
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly schedule
- Event-based (payment received, email arrives)
- Manual/Ad-hoc

**Sequence** (within Business Process):
- Use multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30...) to allow insertions without renumbering
- Parallel workflows can share the same sequence number
- Only required when workflow is part of a multi-step process
- Leave blank for standalone workflows

## Examples by Domain

|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Lead Qualification | Identify and score prospects using research tools and qualification criteria. Produces ranked lead list with contact details. | Qualified lead list |

## Usage Workflow

When user provides a workflow description:

1. **Identify domain** (based on business function)
2. **Determine pattern** (creation, monitoring, distribution, etc.)
3. **Generate 2-3 name options** using relevant pattern
4. **Write description** (action + outcome)
5. **Suggest Process Outcome** (concrete deliverable)
6. **Present options** for user selection
7. **Search Business Processes** to suggest appropriate process link
8. **Determine Sequence** if part of a multi-step process:
   - Query existing workflows under the same Business Process
   - Assign next available multiple of 10 (or ask user for placement)
   - Use same sequence number for parallel workflows
9. **Create entry in Notion** after user confirms selections

## Creating Workflow Entry

After user confirms name, description, and process outcome:

1. **Search Business Processes** using `Notion:notion-search` with relevant keywords
2. **Present process options** and let user confirm or create new
3. **Query existing workflows** under the selected Business Process to determine next Sequence number
4. **Create workflow entry** using `Notion:notion-create-pages`:

```json
{
  "parent": {"data_source_id": "26fedcfd-b924-80c2-9a3a-000bfafb9fe9"},
  "pages": [{
    "properties": {
      "Name": "Workflow Name Here",
      "Description": "Description here.",
      "Process Outcome": "Outcome here",
      "Status": "Under Development",
      "Type": "Augmented",
      "Trigger": "Weekly (Sunday)",
      "Sequence": 10,
      "Business Process": "[\"https://www.notion.so/<business-process-page-id>\"]"
    }
  }]
}
```

**Default values:**
- Status: "Under Development" (new workflows)
- Type: "Augmented" (human-in-the-loop) unless fully automated
- Sequence: Next available multiple of 10 within the Business Process

## Quick Reference

**Name formula:** `[Subject] [Action/Purpose]` (2-4 words, noun phrase)
**Description formula:** `[Action verb] [object] [condition]. [Outcome].` (1-2 sentences)
**Process Outcome:** Concrete deliverable (not "completed workflow")
**Sequence:** Multiples of 10 within Business Process (10, 20, 30...)

## Sequence Example

**Business Process:** ⚡ Lightning Lesson Launch

| Sequence | Workflow | Trigger |
|:--------:|----------|---------|
| 10 | Lightning Lesson Design | Ad-hoc (new lesson idea) |
| 20 | Lightning Lesson Content Creation | 2-3 weeks before event |
| 30 | Lightning Lesson Promotion | 2-3 weeks before event |
| 40 | Lightning Lesson Conversion | Post-event (within 48 hours) |

**Note:** Content Creation (20) and Promotion (30) could share sequence "20" if they run in parallel.
