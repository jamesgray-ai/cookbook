## Success Strategies

### How to Get the Most Out of This Course

**1. Show up to live sessions**
- Attendance is the #1 predictor of success
- Learning happens in real-time troubleshooting and discussion
- Recordings are great for review, but live participation builds skills faster

**2. Do the exercises**
- Every lesson has a hands-on exercise
- These aren't busywork—they're how you build your production systems
- Your capstone project builds on cumulative exercises

**3. Ask questions early**
- Don't wait until you're hopelessly stuck
- Use Slack for quick questions between sessions
- Save complex questions for live sessions or office hours

**4. Build in public**
- Share your work-in-progress in Slack
- Learning from peers accelerates your progress
- Helping others solidifies your own understanding

**5. Focus on implementation, not perfection**
- Build working systems first, refine later
- "Done" is better than "perfect"
- You can iterate on everything you create

**6. Connect concepts to your work**
- Apply every lesson to your actual business workflows
- Build Skills for real problems you're facing
- The best learning comes from solving your own challenges

## What If I Fall Behind?

**If you miss a session:**
1. Watch the recording within 48 hours
2. Complete the exercise from that session
3. Post questions in Slack before the next session
4. Attend office hours if you need catch-up support

**If you get stuck:**
1. Check course materials and supplementary docs
2. Search Slack to see if others solved the same issue
3. Post your question in Slack with screenshots
4. Attend office hours for real-time troubleshooting
5. Use your 1:1 session if the issue is complex or strategic

**If life happens:**
- Communicate in Slack if you need to step away
- Recordings and materials are available for catch-up
- Focus on core modules (Weeks 1-3) if time is limited
- You can revisit advanced topics (Weeks 4-5) later
