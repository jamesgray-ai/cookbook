# Welcome and Course Structure

## Welcome to Claude and Claude Code for Builders

You're here because you're ready to move beyond prompting and start building AI systems that work for you. Over the next 5 weeks, we'll transform you from a Claude user into a Claude builder.

This lesson covers how the course works, what you'll accomplish, and how live sessions are structured.

## What You'll Accomplish in This Course

In 5 weeks, you'll build:

**Week 0 - Course Orientation** (Pre-course)
Week 0 provides an overview of all tools in the AI Builder Stack. While it's suggested to get started with setup before Week 1 if possible, detailed configuration instructions will be covered during Week 1 live sessions. Not all tools need to be configured before the course begins.

**Week 1 - Configure Your AI Builder Stack**
Build the infrastructure that transforms AI from occasional tool to daily operating system. You'll configure code editors, GitHub, Claude Code, voice-to-text tools, and work profiles across Claude platforms—establishing the complete technical foundation that enables all hands-on builder work throughout the course and beyond.

**Week 2 - Build Reusable Claude Skills**
Turn your expertise into reusable AI automation. You'll build production-ready Claude Skills that package your knowledge into instructions Claude can apply across any conversation, deploy them across Claude.ai, Desktop, and Claude Code, and link them to workflows in your registry—building an organized system that scales as you automate more.

**Week 3 - Build Multi-Agent Systems & Deploy Automated Workflows**
Scale your productivity through autonomous AI agents and browser automation. You'll design Claude Subagents with specialized tool permissions, deploy domain-specific experts for code review and analysis, then build browser automation workflows using Claude in Chrome—creating multi-agent systems that execute complex work independently while you focus on higher-level decisions.

**Week 4 - Build with Agentic Coding**
Experience the future of software development. You'll transform business ideas into product specifications with Claude as thought partner, then watch Claude Code autonomously build, test, and refine your application from requirements—experiencing agentic coding workflow that expands what non-engineers can create and accelerates what engineers can ship.

**Week 5 - Build Your Capstone Project**
Complete your transformation from AI user to AI builder. You'll showcase your capstone project demonstrating problem, approach, and results, share transformation insights—what you learned, what surprised you, and what you can now build that wasn't possible before—then chart your path forward with clear next steps for continued growth as an AI builder.

## Course Structure

### Live Sessions

**Schedule:** 2 sessions per week, 90 minutes each
**Days:** Monday + Wednesday
**Format:** Interactive instruction + hands-on implementation + Q&A

**What to expect during live sessions:**
- Real-time teaching with screen sharing and demos
- Step-by-step walkthroughs of technical setup and implementation
- Live troubleshooting when you hit issues
- Group discussions and peer learning
- Dedicated Q&A time for your specific questions

**Participation tips:**
- Come prepared with your AI Builder Stack configured (after Week 0)
- Have questions ready based on pre-work or previous sessions
- Share your screen when you need help troubleshooting
- Use Zoom chat for quick questions, unmute for discussions
- Don't be afraid to ask "how" and "why" questions

### Session Recordings

**Availability:** All live sessions are automatically recorded
**Access:** Recordings are posted to Maven within 24 hours of each session
**Retention:** Lifetime access—you can review recordings anytime

**How to find recordings:**
1. Navigate to the course homepage on Maven
2. Click on the specific week/module
3. Scroll to "Session Recordings"
4. Click to watch

**Best practices:**
- If you miss a live session, watch the recording before the next session
- Use recordings to review complex technical steps at your own pace
- Speed up playback (1.5x or 2x) for review sessions
- Take timestamped notes so you can jump back to specific moments

### Time Commitment

**Total commitment:** 4-6 hours per week

**Breakdown:**
- **Live sessions:** 3 hours (2 x 90 minutes)
- **Exercises & projects:** 1-2 hours between sessions
- **Optional office hours:** 1 hour (if you attend)

**How to manage your time:**
- Block calendar time for live sessions (non-negotiable)
- Schedule 30-60 minutes after each session for exercises
- Batch implementation work on weekends if needed
- Attend office hours when you're stuck, not after you've fallen behind

## Next Steps

Continue to the next lesson: **Access Support and Coaching Resources** to learn about Slack, office hours, and 1:1 coaching.

**Quick actions:**
1. ✅ Block calendar time for Monday + Wednesday live sessions (90 minutes each)
2. ✅ Note that recordings are available if you miss a session
3. ✅ Plan for 4-6 hours total per week including exercises
