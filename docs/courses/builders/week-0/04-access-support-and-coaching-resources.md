## Private Slack Workspace

**Access:** You'll receive a Slack invitation within 24 hours of enrollment
**Channel:** #claude-cohort-[cohort-number] - Your dedicated cohort channel for all communication
**Purpose:** Peer collaboration, troubleshooting, sharing wins, community support

**How to use Slack:**
- Course announcements and general discussion
- Technical troubleshooting and setup questions
- Share completed projects, breakthroughs, and victories
- Post useful tools, articles, and discoveries
- Off-topic chat, introductions, networking

**Slack etiquette:**
- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- Share screenshots when asking for troubleshooting help
- Search before asking—someone may have already solved your issue
- Pay it forward—help others when you can
- Celebrate others' wins (emoji reactions encouraged!)

**Response time:**
- Instructor responses within 24 hours on weekdays
- Peer support is typically faster (minutes to hours)
- Urgent technical issues flagged with @james get priority

## Office Hours

**Schedule:** Saturday mornings (optional)
**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Format:** Open Q&A, troubleshooting, catch-up support
**Additional availability:** 30-minute sessions available throughout the week upon student request

**When to attend office hours:**
- You're stuck on a technical setup step
- You missed a live session and need catch-up support
- You want feedback on your approach before diving deep
- You have questions that don't fit neatly into live session topics

**How office hours work:**
- Show up with specific questions or problems
- Share your screen to demonstrate issues
- Get real-time guidance and troubleshooting
- Learn from others' questions (often more valuable than your own!)

**Pro tip:** Post your question in Slack before office hours so James can prepare.
