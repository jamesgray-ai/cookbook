# Identify Your AI Builder Stack

## Introduction

This course transforms you from a Claude user into a Claude builder. That means working hands-on with a complete AI builder stack—the same tools and infrastructure that power modern AI-first operations.

This lesson sets expectations about what tools we'll use throughout the course. You're welcome to get a head start on setup, but Week 1 (Configure AI Builder Stack) will walk through detailed installation and configuration for everything listed here. Think of this as your shopping list and system check—by the end of this lesson, you'll know exactly what you need and whether your current setup is ready.

The AI Builder Stack isn't just a collection of tools. It's an integrated system where each component plays a specific role in how you build, deploy, and scale AI systems that work for you. Understanding this stack now will help you see how everything connects as we progress through the course.

## Preview: What Happens in Week 1

Week 1 (Configure AI Builder Stack) provides detailed setup instructions for:

1. Verifying Claude subscription and usage limits
2. Setting up GitHub
3. Configuring code editor (Cursor or VS Code) with Claude integration
4. Installing Claude Desktop and connecting your first MCP tool
5. Installing Claude in Chrome extension and testing browser automation
6. Installing Claude Code CLI and verifying setup
7. Creating your Agentic AI Registry structure in Notion
8. Testing the full stack with a simple end-to-end workflow

You'll work through setup independently using the provided lessons and documentation. During live sessions, we'll troubleshoot any issues, answer questions, and ensure everyone's stack is working properly before we start building.

## Why This Stack?

Every tool serves a specific purpose in your AI builder workflow:

- **Claude.ai** → Your command center, where you interact with Claude
- **GitHub** → Your version control system, where you manage and share Skills
- **Cursor/VS Code** → Your editing environment, where you create and refine Skills
- **Claude Desktop** → Your workflow development and execution environment, where you build, test, and run local workflows
- **Claude Code** → Your autonomous coding agent, where ideas become prototypes
- **Claude in Chrome** → Your automation layer, where you orchestrate web tasks
- **Wispr Flow** → Your voice interface, where speech becomes text across your entire workflow
- **Notion (Registry)** → Your organizational system, where you track everything you build

Together, these tools form a complete AI Builder Stack—the infrastructure you need to build, deploy, and scale AI systems that work for you.

## Questions?

If you're uncertain about any of these tools or whether your setup will work, don't worry. Week 1 includes setup lessons for each tool, and we'll troubleshoot together during live sessions.

**Common questions we'll address in Week 1:**
- "I don't have admin access—can I still participate?"
- "Can I use a different code editor?"
- "What if Claude in Chrome isn't available in my region?"
- "I've never used GitHub—is that a problem?"

Come to Week 1 ready to configure your stack, and we'll make sure you're set up for success.
